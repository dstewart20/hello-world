# hello-world
A basic intro on how to use GitHub properly. 
My name is N. Dante Stewart, I am a recent Grad. from DePauw University interested in blockchain tech. I'm getting more familiar with Github so that I can crowdsource projects that interest me. I already know how to use Github, but this is like refreshing old skills so no mistakes are made, and I can be super efficient with my work.
